# RAID

## Redundant Array of Independent Disks

- RAID 0:
  - Very fast, but not focused on backing up information.
- RAID 1:
  - Not focused on speed, focused on redundantly storing information to minimize loss in the event of a failure.
- RAID 3:
  - Weird, we don't need to worry about it.
- RAID 5: 
  - Very fast way to back up information between 3 separate drives.
  - Uses a buffer manager.
