THE AMERICAN YAWP 23. The Great Depression:

-   No one was buying or borrowing because no one could find work, which cause more people to be fired and less people to be able to find work, which lead to less people buying and borrowing.
-   Banks were caught in speculation and were unable to deposit all the money the people were trying to withdraw, and closed down.
-   The Great Depression was the final act of a lot of issues in American society becoming fully realized (people not being involved in the stock market, income inequality, automation, bank failure and overextension, etc.)
-   Hoover began to be blamed for the Great Depression.
-   People begged Hoover to use the government's resources to help end the Depression but he believed that government should have as little interference as possible on the people and did too little, too late to help.
-   Charities very quickly ran out of money to give and had to close down.
-   Nonwhites were hit exceptionally hard by the Depression since they were last in priority.
-   Great migration west happened when the Midwest had lost its ability to grow and sell their food at acceptable prices.
-   Dust Bowl played a big part in the migration, blowing topsoil everywhere and destroying crops.
-   Many migrants were quickly deported to their country of origin since policies became super strict. (More people left the U.S. than entered it during the Great Depression)
-   Bonus Army, left destitute by the Great Depression, demanded their cash bonuses from serving in WWI.
-   Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in 1932 in a landslide because people didn't want Hoover anymore.
-   FDR got polio and was left as a paraplegic.
-   He offered a New Deal to the American people, and this made him very popular.
-   "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself"
-   "Roosevelt's reassuring words would have rung hollow if he had not taken swift action against the economic crisis. In his first days in office, Roosevelt and his advisors prepared, submitted, and secured congressional enactment of numerous laws designed to arrest the worst of the Great Depression. His administration threw the federal government headlong into the fight against the Depression. Roosevelt immediately looked to stabilize the collapsing banking system. Two out of every five banks open in 1929 had been shuttered and some Federal Reserve banks were on the verge of insolvency. Roosevelt declared a national "bank holiday" closing American banks and set to work pushing the Emergency Banking Act swiftly through Congress. On March 12, the night before select banks reopened under stricter federal guidelines, Roosevelt appeared on the radio in the first of his Fireside Chats. The addresses, which the president continued delivering through four terms, were informal, even personal. Roosevelt used his airtime to explain New Deal legislation, to encourage confidence in government action, and to mobilize the American people's support. In the first chat, Roosevelt described the new banking safeguards and asked the public to place their trust and their savings in banks. Americans responded and deposits outpaced withdrawals across the country. The act was a major success. In June, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Banking Act, which instituted a federal deposit insurance system through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and barred the mixing of commercial and investment banking."
-   1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, established a minimum wage.
-   FDR created alphabet agencies to help arrest the biggest problems in the Depression, and most of these agencies helped the South as a primary target.
-   FDR radically changed Southern thinking on inequality.
-   Huey Long criticized the Federal Gov't for not redistribution the wealth of the ultra-rich.
-   These critics and lessening support for FDR, especially in the South and the Supreme Court, resulted in several important agencies being declared unconstitutional and shut down.
-   Second New Deal was a more ambitious and radical version of his previous plan, with a large focus on rights for workers.
-   New Deal largely failed to aid Black Americans and women.
-   New Deal was very popular for a time, but several mistakes by Roosevelt and advisors cause the New Deal to fall to the backburner as conflicts heated up in Europe.
-   New Deal's legacy still shapes American politics.



Did the Real Estate Boom Cause the Great Depression?:

-   Could have been a contributing factor since American's continued to build larger and taller structures, forcing real estate to match and possibly worsening the effects of the Great Depression.



"Share the Wealth":

-   Basically lambasting FDR for raising the national debt and taking more money for the government to use in their programs, and advertising his own parties programs to redistribute wealth from the rich and give it to the poor, and give pensions to the elderly, veterans, and educate all children.
