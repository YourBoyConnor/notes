Struct a, Struct b



a = b will compile, a == b will not (Even if they have identical arguments)



Struct Arguments are passed by value, can return structs in functions



-> Operator:



Given a pointer to a struct, we can use the -> operator to reference the fields of the struct



Cannot do *p.y, but -> is shorthand for (*p).y



For coding style, do p->y instead of (*p).y

Representing character standards:



ASCII



EBCDIC



UNICODE:

-   UTF: Unicode Transformation Format
-   UTF-32:
-   UTF-16:
-   UTF-8:
