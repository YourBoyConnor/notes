THE AMERICAN YAWP, Chapter 21, World War I & Its Aftermath:

-   Germany was jealous of the British empire and Navy, so King Wilhelm II started aggressively looking for territory.
-   The Austro-Hungarian Empire wanted to eliminate the Serbian threat after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
-   George Washington's 1796 Farewell Address recommended against foreign alliances with overgrown militaries.
-   U.S. economy was growing, but U.S. military was small and dilapidated, so many acts (The Davis Act of 1908 and the National Defense Act of 1916) allowed for the construction of a modern navy and the rise of the National Guard and military reserves.
-   Naval Act of 1916 allowed Woodrow Wilson to create a Navy that was "incomparably, the greatest . . . in the world."
-   Sinking of the RMS Lusitania "raised the ire of the public and stoked the desire for war."
-   Complex European alliances caused many countries to join the war, and the Zimmerman telegram to Mexico was the real push for the U.S. to join on the side of the Allied Powers.
-   The Selective Service Act was set up around this time to draft men into the war.
-   The intelligence tests to join the military were set up quite poorly and didn't really represent the intelligence of immigrants.
-   There were separate units for white and black members of the military.
-   Women performed the bulk of volunteer work in both military and civilian sectors during the war.
-   Black women were generally kept out of wartime efforts and civilian organizations.
-   Committee on Public Information was basically a propaganda committee formed under Wilson.
-   European front was chaotic. Tsarist Russia fell in 1917 and the military fell with it, but with the support of American troops, the Western front was able to defend against the German military and Germany's defeat was inevitable.
-   Influenza Pandemic spread the flu around the U.S. from Kansas to the entire U.S., then mutated in a way that allowed it to kill people ages 18-25 at a disproportionate rate. It spread to Europe before fading in the early 1920's with no cure ever being found.
-   Wilson's 14 points for entering the war were drafted after, with the League of Nations being in it.
    -   However, leaders of European powers wanted several severe sanctions placed on Germany and they got it.
-   The U.S. was never able to join the League of Nations due to domestic opponents, which caused it to inevitably fail due to a lack of American power.
-   Aftermath:
    -   Ottoman empire broken up into land owned by Britain and France, U.S. declined land
    -   Red Scare pushed by 1917 Russian Revolution caused widespread nervousness about immigrants.
    -   Racial tensions reached their peak in the U.S. with the "Red Summer": a ton of riots and bloodshed, with the Chicago Riot being the worst.
    -   Gutted the Progressive hopes of the prewar era.
