THE AMERICAN YAWP 24. World War II:

-   Origins included Japan blaming an act of war on China and going to war with them, invading Manchuria and quickly defeating China because they were weak at the time. This marked the start of Japanese aggressive military expansionism.
-   China was also battling the communists around this time.
-   In Europe, Nazi Party crushed all dissidents and broke German tradition with Hitler proceeding to arm the Rhineland and taking back some of the land that was taken during the Treaty of Versailles.
-   While Hitler was expanding Germany, the Russians made a deal with Stalin (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) to coordinate the attacking and splitting of Poland by both parties.
-   Took Poland, took France, tried to take England but failed. Germany began bombing the hell out of British cities.
-   Hitler then invaded the Soviet Union, and was initially very successful, but Russian Scorched Earth strategies stalled the German Invasion long enough to get German troops caught in Russian Winter.
-   America officially joined the war after Pearl Harbor, and began their invasion in French Morocco and pushed east while the British pushed the German advance back to the West.
-   Pushing into Italy was harder than the Allies first though due to natural barriers, but Mussolini's people revolted and quickly made peace with the Allies.
-   The Nazi's began losing on both fronts, the Allies closing in on Berlin where Hitler and his high command killed themselves.
-   Japan vs. America was a more vicious war in many ways than the European front since the Japanese were unwilling to surrender by any means and America was racist, so both parties were relentless in their brutality.
-   American's pushed the Japanese out of the Philippines until their bombers were in range of the mainland.
-   The Manhattan Project
-   America dunked on Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the Little Boy and the Fat Man, killing around 180,000, followed in short order by a Japanese surrender.
-   Germans fought similarly to Americans, but the Japanese fought brutally, viewing surrender as cowardice and fighting until the last man or suicide to be more honorable than surrender, very different than the American view point as a "fanatical loss of life".
-   WWII brought the U.S. out of Depression and allowed the Allies to utilize the full might of America's huge industrial capacity.
-   Bracero contracts between U.S. and Mexico allowed migrant workers to work in California as contractors, but they were treated quite badly and perceptions among workers were mixed.
-   Women played a big part in the war effort and brough new labor opportunities to them.
-   Jim Crow, however, remained a problem for Black women to contribute to the war effort.
-   By far the biggest tradeoff was race relation during and post-WWII. Black servicemen were segregated, NAACP memberships exploded, many nonwhite American's and Non-Americans were detained or segregated, especially, Germans, Jews, and the Japanese members of America.
-   Needed a new international peace commission since the League of Nations was powerless.
-   United Nations created, with 50 nations, including the U.S, England, Soviet Union, and China.
-   G.I. Bill provided benefits to veterans gradually so the government didn't get overwhelmed by 15 million people cashing out their bonuses at once.
-   Cold War looming in the future.



Was the Hiroshima Bomb Necessary?:

-   This author believes both bombs were necessary to sway Japan into action.
-   Counter argument includes the massive potential dangers of an international nuclear arms race, which happened several years later, so it holds some weight.



The Way We Won:

-   "America's response to World War II was the most extraordinary mobilization of an idle economy in the history of the world."
-   America won abroad and domestically at the same time.
-   WWII also fostered many more social events and programs for citizens to unwind and distract themselves from war.
