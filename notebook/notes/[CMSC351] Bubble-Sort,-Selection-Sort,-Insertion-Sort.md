Bubble Sort:

- In Place, Stable, O(1) (Actually Theta(1)) Space Complexity
- O(n^2^) Time complexity, but can be improved by checking if the array is sorted after each pass

Selection Sort:

- In Place, Unstable, O(1) Space Complexity
- O(n^2^) Time Complexity

Insertion Sort (NOT ON EXAM 1):

- In Place, Stable, O(1) Space Complexity
- O(n^2) worst case/average case, O(n) best case
