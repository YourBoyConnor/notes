- We have a list of integers: [-9,3,1,1,4,-2,-8]
- There are many contiguous sub-lists: for example [3,1,1], [1,1], [4], [4,-2], [-2,-8], ....
- The sub-list [3,4] is NOT a contiguous sub-list
- What is the maximum sum for all the possible contiguous sub-lists?
  - 9, generated by the sub-list [3,1,1,4]

MCS - Brute Force #1

- Look at all the possible sub-lists, calculate their sum, take the max of all of them
  - Look at all the possible sub-lists, calculate their sum, take the max of all of them
  - A sub-list is defined by a starting index and an ending index

MCS - Divide and Conquer Approach

- Recursive calls to get the MCS for the left and right half of the list (Base case is when the list has 1 element, that element is MCS)
  - But what if there is a better solution straddling the middle? Find an anchor on the right for the left half and anchor on the left for the right half to account for this.
  - Cmax = lhmax + rhmax
