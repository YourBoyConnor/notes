It is important for each one of you to attend each presentation and speak during the online presentations. You will evaluate all presentations (except yours!) - and your evaluations will factor into the final grades. These evaluations will be done online, in class. I will be evaluating the in-class presentation as well as the submitted file.



Questions that students will use to evaluate every presentation:

Q: How thorough is the analysis presented?

Q: How likely is this innovation to be profitable?



Group 1: RELA

1.  

    -   Utilized interviews and environmental scans to identify a need for their product.
    -   They account for people stealing their products by taking inspiration from VEO, fining people who attempt to steal since they already have their card information.
    -   Take pricing strategy into account, must price their products fairly and are willing to do market research and focus groups to land on the right price.

2.  

    -   Depending on their pricing strategy, they may be profitable, but I do not think they will be profitable since people who care about inclement weather already have the tools to deal with it and people who don't care will not use this product. I think relying only on people who forget their weather equipment when it happens suddenly is not a large enough market to justify the fairly large initial investment.

Group 6: Handlebar Bike Lock

1.  

    -   Still expensive? Would not actually prevent bike theft?
    -   Detailed market research into existing solutions (chain locks, U-locks, cable locks, etc.)
    -   Perform detailed core benefit proposition

2.  

    -   I think this could be profitable, especially if there is an attachment that they create to wrap the handlebars around a grounding object, since I'm not buying the efficacy of just locking the front wheel in place.

Group #: Pet Motion

1.  

    -   Good target market, specific enough to target with advertising
    -   Good research into several tracking alternatives
    -   Summarized sales pitch into core benefit proposition
    -   Unique target market that doesn't have a ton of competitors
    -   Large market in terms of people adopting new puppies since COVID, may not necessarily be prepared to keep track of their dog.

2.  

    -   This could be very profitable, especially if they are able to solve the problem of high prices for integrated collar solutions like Fi. Good idea to do a GPS Subscription model.
