    -   Options for more professional financial advice
-   You mentioned financial literacy not being required in schools, would you consider partnering with schools (middle and high schools) to rectify that problem?
-   Good thinking to circumvent financial advice legal road bump



Campus Fit:

-   Student driven athletic apparel brand
-   Under Armour specifically is geared towards UMD since they are based in Maryland and Kevin Plank went to UMD. So competing with a brand like Under Armour will be very difficult
