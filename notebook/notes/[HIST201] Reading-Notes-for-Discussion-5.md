American Yawp Chapter 18: IV. The New South and the Problem of Race

-   The North wanted the South to embrace industrialization and diversified agriculture, but they did not at all
-   Public torture, mutilation, and murder happened at lynchings
-   "Whenever the Constitution comes between me and the virtue of the white women of South Carolina (common excuse for lynching), I say to hell with the Constitution."
-   "Red Shirt" groups, or terrorist groups, wanted to limit black power through intimidation and violence.
-   Wilmington, after the black leaders failed to get enough signatures, they just walked around the city killing every black person they saw.
-   A core issue for southern whites was black men being with white women, so they passed legislation to ban it.
-   Jim Crow voting laws
-   "Lost Cause" champions were delusional people who romanticized life during slavery. (Birth of a Nation almost revived the Klan)
-   "Better-paying jobs were reserved for whites, while the most dangerous, labor-intensive, dirtiest, and lowest-paying positions were relegated to African Americans."
-   "The trains came, factories were built, and capital was invested, but the region remained mired in poverty and racial apartheid."



American Yawp Chapter 20: Jim Crow and African American Life

-   "Democratic Party candidates stirred southern whites into frenzies with warnings of "negro domination" and of Black men violating white women." BRUH
-   Former Populists became some of the biggest supporters for Jim Crow.
-   Justice John Harlan the GOAT, lone dissenter on Plessy v. Ferguson
-   Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute (Andrew Carnegie supported him)
-   "In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress."



A Governor Bitterly Opposes Negro Education

-   James K. Vardaman was the governor of Mississippi in 1904-1908, staunch white supremacist
-   "I am the n****** best friend" How delusional are these guys?
-   "The negroes who can read and write are more criminal than the illiterate, which is true of no other element of our population."





Atlanta Exposition Speech

-   "Nearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load upwards, or they will pull you against

the load downwards. We shall constitute one third and more of the ignorance and crime of the South,

or one third its intelligence and progress; we shall contribute one third to the business and industrial

prosperity of the South, or we shall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing, retarding

every effort to advance the body politic."



The Niagara Movement

-   "In 1905, Du Bois and twenty-nine other African American political activists met near Niagara Falls to form the Niagara movement, a predecessor to the NAACP."
-   "We want discrimination in public accommodation to cease. Separation in railway and street cars, based simply on race and color, is un-American, un-democratic, and silly. We protest against all such discrimination." TALK TO EM W.E.B.
-   "We are not more lawless than the white race, we are more often arrested, convicted, and mobbed."
-   "Either the United States will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the United States."



Lynch Law in America

-   A bunch of statistics about lynching in the U.S. broken up by different states.
-   "Humiliating indeed, but altogether unanswerable, was the reply of the French press to our protest: 'Stop your lynchings at home before you send your protests abroad.'"
