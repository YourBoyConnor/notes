Questions that students will use to evaluate every presentation:

Q: How thorough is the analysis presented?

Q: How likely is this innovation to be profitable?



Group #: Dry Rak

1.  

    -   Thorough design plan, clear diagram
    -   Good competitive pricing analysis
    -   Testing is thorough
    -   EXTREMELY detailed business model

2.  

    -   Probably very likely to be profitable if the product can make profit at $200, because that seems pretty steep.



Group 3: ParkPlus

1.  

    -   Detailed market analysis, especially when college students are the focus
    -   Very well designed slide deck, very easy to follow (for the most part)
    -   VERY TEXT HEAVY on some slides, makes some harder to follow.



2.  

    -   Could be profitable, but the close competition with SpotHero may make growth more difficult with such a similar competitor.



Group 3: Dream Solutions

1.  

    - Different kind of service, interesting proposal (consulting)
    - Detailed service offering
    - Kind of confusing how they would compete with existing consulting services

2.  

    -   I don't think this will be profitable, they are basically maintaining someone else's business for them, I don't think people would go for it. If they pivoted to advertising or something, I think it would be a better idea.
