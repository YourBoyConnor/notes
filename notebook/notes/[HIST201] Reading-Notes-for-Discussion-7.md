THE AMERICAN YAWP, Chapter 19, American Empire:

-   Guano Islands Act of 1856 - Declared the Guano Islands in the Pacific the property of the United States
-   American and Mexican relations were soured in the early 1900's after Woodrow Wilson put pressure on a Mexican president Huerta, who then fell and another president, Carranza, took power. His rival, Villa, started attacking American interests and they fought for a while before the U.S. pulled out due to a looming war in Europe. (WWI)
-   Very little interest in the Middle East, but some missionaries helped develop educational institutions with their lack of converts.
-   Spanish-American War caused by explosion of the U.S.S. Maine, where the U.S. began rapidly taking Spanish settlements in Cuba and the Philippines.
-   The U.S. got Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines for winning the war.
-   After the U.S. took the Philippines, instead of letting the country self-govern, the U.S. remained stationed there and began fighting against the revolutionaries they were previously fighting with.
-   Prominent anti-imperialists included Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie, and Jane Addams.
-   Roosevelt worked under McKinley to expand American influence as the assistant secretary of the Navy.
-   Roosevelt became Vice President to McKinley and rose to the presidency after McKinley was assassinated by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist.
-   Roosevelt Corollary reinforced U.S. police power in the western hemisphere after the Monroe Doctrine.
-   As the U.S. intervened in South American politics, it usually resulted in a heavily destabilized country after a U.S. aligned president was installed.
-   As America continued its expansion, it was shown by Roosevelt as a purely masculine exploit, but it offered many opportunities for white, middle class women at home as well. (business representatives, missionaries, teachers, medical professionals, artists/writers)
-   Through this, women heavily supported imperialism. Of courses, not everyone did, and many opposed it. White women like Jane Addams and Josephine Shaw Lowell spoke out against imperialism as support for the democratic foundations of the U.S. and opposition to violence. Black female activists spoke out against unfair treatment of foreigners, like Filipinos.
-   Many immigrants continued to come to the U.S., with traditional immigrants fearing new immigrants from Asia would reduce immigrant wages more and they protested against them.
-   In California, anti-Chinese sentiments had peaked in the middle of the 1800's and caused the passage of the Page act, which banned the immigration of convicted criminals, Asian laborers who were brought involuntarily, and women brought for the purpose of prostitution. The Chinese Exclusion Act followed, making the Chinese the first illegal immigrants in the U.S.
-   Immigration Act of 1882 denied admission to "people who were not able to support themselves and those, such as paupers, people with mental illnesses, or convicted criminals, who might otherwise threaten the security of the nation"
-   "Many immigration critics were responding to the shifting demographics of American immigration. The center of immigrant-sending regions shifted from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe and Asia. These "new immigrants" were poorer, spoke languages other than English, and were likely Catholic or Jewish. White Protestant Americans typically regarded them as inferior, and American immigration policy began to reflect more explicit prejudice than ever before."
-   Unofficial "ethnic parishes" formed to give each different ethnic group and opportunity to practice their own form of Catholicism.



The Roosevelt Corollary/"To Roosevelt"

-   Extension on the Monroe Doctrine, defined the role of full police power for the U.S. in the western hemisphere.
-   South America did not like the Roosevelt Corollary
