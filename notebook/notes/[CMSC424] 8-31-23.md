DBMS = DataBase Management System



Structured vs. Unstructured Data: Most DBs are structured because they are standardized and easy to work with, but unstructured data like social networks, map data, web links, etc. are becoming increasingly important to optimize for databases.

-   Also semi-structed data that complicates stuff a lot, like XML.



Data Modeling: Applies high level reasoning and logic to data

Data Abstraction/Independence: Layer the system so that users only have to worry about high level functions and they are shielded from the low level part of a system



Data Model: A collection of concepts that describe how data is represented

-   Examples: XML, JSON, Object-Oriented, Object-Relational, etc.

Schema: A description of a specific collection of data, using a given data model



Purpose of DBMS is to store, manage, and facilitate access to DBs.

-   Provides:
    -   Data Definition Language (DDL)
        -   For defining and modifying the schemas
    -   Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        -   Retrieving modifying, and analyzing data



SQL = Structured Query Language

-   DDL Example:
    -   THIS IS R BELOW: 

CREATE TABLE instructor {

| ID        | Char(5),       |
|-----------|----------------|
| Name      | Varchar(20),   |
| Dept_name | Varchar(20),   |
| Salary    | Numeric(8, 2), |
};

-   DML Example: Find the name of the instructor with ID 22222
    -   SELECT name
    -   FROM instructor
    -   WHERE instructor.ID = '22222'



Common Open Source DBMSs:

-   MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Derby, BerkeleyDB (primarily storage engine, no SQL), neo4j (primarily graph data)



Embedded SQL: Calling SQL from within programming languages



Keys: Let K be a subset of R:

-   K is a superkey of R if values for K are sufficient to identify a unique row of any possible table.
-   Superkey K is a candidate key if K is minimal (no subset of it is a superkey)
-   One candidate key can be the primary key
    -   Typically one that is small and immutable



More DDL Examples:

CREATE TABLE department {
| Dept_name | Varchar(20),                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| Building  | Varchar(15),                       |
| Budget    | Numeric(12,2) check (budget > 0), |
Primary key (dept_name)
};

CREATE TABLE instructor {
| ID        | whatever     |
|-----------|--------------|
| Name      | whatever     |
| Dept_name | Varchar(20)  |
| Salary    | Numeric(8,2) |
Foreign key (dept_name) references department
Primary key (dept_name)
};



Foreign Key Operations:

-   If a department is deleted, due to the references statement above, the programmer will have to define what happens if any necessary data is dropped
    -   Reject the delete: Nothing
    -   Delete rows in instructor: On delete cascade
    -   Set rows to null in instructor: On delete set null



SQL Operation Examples:

-   DROP TABLE student
-   DELETE FROM student WHERE <condition>
-   ALTER TABLE <table> ADD <column> | (change data type) ALTER COLUMN <column> | DROP COLUMN <column>
-   INSERT INTO <name> (<field names>) VALUES (<field values>)



Subqueries:

-   Can do queries within queries to evaluate data that depends on values in the database





<- defines maximum decimal point
