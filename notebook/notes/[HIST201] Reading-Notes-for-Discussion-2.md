    - Immigrants from Asia and Europe came looking for work
    - Some immigrants aimed to just get enough money to buy land in their home country, but some stayed in America and formed their own ethnic neighborhoods and advertised this life to people they knew back home
    - City political machines were very corrupt, but they did help respond to immigrant needs and kept things mostly in order (Tammany Hall, George Washington Plunkett)
    - Rural areas and agriculture were screwed up with so many people moving to the cities, so suburban areas in the early 20th century were created to allow people to avoid both urban sprawl and rural decay
