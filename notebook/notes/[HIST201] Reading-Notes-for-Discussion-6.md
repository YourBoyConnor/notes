THE AMERICAN YAWP Chapter 20: The Progressive Era

-   Industrial Era rapidly brought change to religious, political, and social structures.
-   Triangle Shirtwaist Fire highlighted ridiculously bad working conditions for factory workers.
-   Jacob Riis also displayed the terrible conditions of people living in the slums of NYC to the American people and photographed it to provide evidence.
-   Upton Sinclair's aim in "The Jungle" was to bolster support for the socialist movement by exposing worker exploitation in the meat packing industry, but it just raised visibility to the largely invisible meat packing industry and enabled the passing of several laws, such as the Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.
-   Increasing visibility of the Social Gospel: A protestant Christian movement that encouraged people to act for the good of society and challenge existing structures.
-   However, these reform beliefs only went as far as white men, and the plights of women, African Americans, Native Americans, etc. were largely ignored. But, they did inspire future visionaries such as MLK Jr.
-   Women had many more opportunities with all the social reform, forming (usually segregated) women's clubs, but Black women preached for the reform of all.
-   All of these pushes by women ended up with 6 states passing suffrage amendments into their constitutions by 1911.
-   Right before WWI, the final push for women's suffrage happened and Woodrow Wilson supported women's suffrage and helped amend it into the Constitution.
-   Trusts were very controversial during this time, including Carnegie Steel and Standard Oil Company, and became targets of reformers. Several pieces of legislation were used to fight them, including the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, which was circumvented and replaced by the Hepburn Act, allowing the Federal Government to regulate interstate commerce with the Clayton Anti-Trust Act following with Wilson later.
-   Environmental preservation was also a major point of reform.
-   Taken from the previous week for Jim Crow and African American Life:
    -   The North wanted the South to embrace industrialization and diversified agriculture, but they did not at all
    -   Public torture, mutilation, and murder happened at lynchings
    -   "Whenever the Constitution comes between me and the virtue of the white women of South Carolina (common excuse for lynching), I say to hell with the Constitution."
    -   "Red Shirt" groups, or terrorist groups, wanted to limit black power through intimidation and violence.
    -   Wilmington, after the black leaders failed to get enough signatures, they just walked around the city killing every black person they saw.
    -   A core issue for southern whites was black men being with white women, so they passed legislation to ban it.
    -   Jim Crow voting laws
    -   "Lost Cause" champions were delusional people who romanticized life during slavery. (Birth of a Nation almost revived the Klan)
    -   "Better-paying jobs were reserved for whites, while the most dangerous, labor-intensive, dirtiest, and lowest-paying positions were relegated to African Americans."
    -   "The trains came, factories were built, and capital was invested, but the region remained mired in poverty and racial apartheid."



Buck vs. Bell:

-   Eugenics involves sterilizing or killing those who are deemed "unfit" so they are unable to procreate, is now a discredited science. Oliver Wendell Holmes, a Supreme Court Justice, was a proponent of eugenics.



Address to Congress on Women's Suffrage:

-   Carrie Chapman Catt wrote a letter to Congress as the final push for women's suffrage that served as the final push needed for the 19th amendment to be passed into the Constitution.
