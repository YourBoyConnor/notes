## hello world.rb

puts ''Hello, World!"

Ruby uses dynamic and latent typing

- Type Checking: The process of determining a variable's type
- Dynamic Typing: Type checking is performed at run-time
- Static Typing: Type checking is performed at compile-time
- Manifest (explicit) typing: explicitly telling the compiler the type of new variables
  - Types are associated with variables
- Latent (implicit) typing: not needing to give a type to variable
  - Types are associated with values

Everything is a class

Reminders about OOP:

- Values are references to Objects
- Objects are instances of Classes
- Classes inherit from each other

Class Creation

- Var = local variable
- @var = instance variable
- @@var = global variable
- Things to Remember:
  - Instance variables are private by default
  - Last line in a method is returned
  - No method Overloading
