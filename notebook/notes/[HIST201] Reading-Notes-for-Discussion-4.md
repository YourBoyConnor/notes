American Yawp: PHOTOS ON PHONE!



Video - Myths about the Frontier:
-   The rugged man was a myth since the capturing of the natives/railroads was done with the heavy assistance of the federal gov't.
-   Frederick Jackson Turner largely perpetuated the myth that the frontier was built on the independence and "American Spirit"



Gunfighting in the Old West:

-   There were very few, if any, "duels" or standoffs, with law enforcement (Nathaniel Boswell) choosing to use a shotgun, as they were very effective, and concealing himself to catch the criminal unaware.
-   Most cowboys either disliked guns or stayed away from gun violence because the "police-court judge" would ruthlessly punish them.



Fetterman Massacre of 1866:

-   Was the Native's revenge for the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864
-   Crazy Horse and Red Cloud discovered that they could bait U.S. forces by pretending to be defenseless, then ambush them.
-   81 fatalities on the U.S. side, worst defeat until the battle of Little Bighorn.



Sand Creek Massacre (two soldiers object):

-   Could not find this one on the link sent, but the Sand Creek Massacre was a surprise attack on the Cheyenne and Arapaho people after a battle where the Natives had surrendered, but more than 230 men, women, and children from both tribes were massacred.



Social Darwinism and the Poor:

-   Mass poverty, immigration, and changing American circumstances fueled a belief known as Social Darwinism, which is basically the belief that some people are less fit than others (usually rich vs. poor, whites vs. blacks, Americans vs immigrants, etc.). This was mostly a conservative belief, whereas liberals thought that Social Darwinism could be used to nurture better people by giving young people the chance to learn and succeed.
-   Often used in contradictory ways by upper-class people to justify why they were better than lower classes.



The Omaha Platform: Launching the Populist Party:

-   The Omaha Platform was the document that officially brought the Populists into the political sphere and defined their core beliefs on paper, like bimetallism, labor unions, breaking up train monopolies, paper money, income tax, etc.
