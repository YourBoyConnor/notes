## [Capital and Labor, Parts V-VIII:]{.underline}

- Populist Leader, Mary Elizabeth Lease, claimed that "Wall Street owns the country" while speaking to a group of farmers disenfranchised by industrialization.
- Farmer's organized to create the Populist Party.
- Started as a workers union to help farmers negotiate, but became a legitimate political party and began gaining support across the nation.
- James B. Weaver, former Civil War general, was their presidential candidate.
- Proposed many changes and bolstering of federal power, federalizing railroads, telegraphs, and things to help farmers not have to go to private industry for debt.
- The counter-strategy from southern democrats was "electoral fraud and racial demagoguery".
- William Jennings Bryan was important because he decided to use his excellent speaking skill to defend the working class by changing to the silver standard (silver vs. gold standard was a very heated debate at this time)
- Bryan is unable to defeat McKinley, and the Gold Standard act silences this debate.
- Populist movement was most significant third party in history, and laid the groundwork for the coming progressive movement.
- Socialists spawned out of the populists, and advocated for the collective ownership of the means of production.
- After WWI, the party sank due to a variety of issues.

## [The Problem of the Children:]{.underline}

- This reading brings up the very good point of a mass movement of mistreatment for children.
- The writer argues that "children are not naturally vicious nor hardened," they are a product of their environment growing up. A kid who has to steal for food to live will steal more as an adult. By changing this behavior in its infancy, the future of America can be improved.

## [The Street Arab:]{.underline}

- Goes with the previous reading, talks about boys who are homeless and roam the streets.
- Writer argues that some of the positive traits of these kinds of boys, like moral justice, intelligence, and independence are very useful for more learned professions.
- Talks of some organizations who help children, like the "Children's Aid Society".

## [What Does Labor Want?:]{.underline}

- One important point: Labor and Products are fundamentally different. Products can be sold over a period of time, and it can be sold again tomorrow if it does not sell today. But Labor is a constant and continuous process, and if someone does not work, that potential work is forever lost.
- Labor essentially wants the work day to be reduced to eight hours now, and to fewer in the future.
