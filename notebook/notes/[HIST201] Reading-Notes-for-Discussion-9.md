THE AMERICAN YAWP - 22. The New Era:
-   1920's were a very chaotic time under Harding for both good and bad reasons.
-   Harding's presidency was extremely corrupt, but several members of his cabinet were good. (Wallace, Hoover, Mellon)
-   Mostly just his friends, the "Ohio Gang", "Teapot Dome Scandal" resulted in 2 cabinet members going to jail and Harding to die of a heart attack, allowing Calvin Coolidge to rise to president.
-   Great activism among American women, helped lead to the eighteenth amendment banning the production and sale of alcohol.
-   Republican dominance, Herbert Hoover defeated Al Smith in a landslide election, mostly due to his Catholic Religious Views.
-   New products such as "ready-to-wear clothing, convenience foods, and home appliances."
-   Many dry-goods houses pivoted into department stores to sell all these goods, one of the most successful among them being Marshall Field & Co.
-   Automobile purchases pivoted to using credit.
-   "In the late 1920's, 80 percent of the world's cars drove on American roads."
-   1920's embodied escapist ideals through cars or radio or pop culture in general.
-   U.S. dominated global firm industry.
-   Warner Bros., Universal, Paramount, Columbia, and MGM were all founded and led by Jewish executives and immigrants.
-   African American's were still excluded or segregated in movie theaters.
-   "The Flapper" was popularized during this time.
-   America craved heroes like Jack Dempsey and Babe Ruth.
-   "The rising emphasis on spending and accumulation nurtured a national ethos of materialism and individual pleasure."
-   "Women undoubtedly gained much in the 1920s. There was a profound and keenly felt cultural shift that, for many women, meant increased opportunity to work outside the home. The number of professional women, for example, significantly rose in the decade. But limits still existed, even for professional women. Occupations such as law and medicine remained overwhelmingly male: most female professionals were in feminized professions such as teaching and nursing. And even within these fields, it was difficult for women to rise to leadership positions."
-   "There were many women in the decade of differing races, classes, ethnicities, and experiences, just as there were many men with different experiences. For some women, the 1920s were a time of reorganization, new representations, and new opportunities. For others, it was a decade of confusion, contradiction, new pressures, and struggles new and old."
-   Destruction of the Greenwood district still indicated horrible treatment of Black people during this time period.
-   African Americans were vital to the entertainment revolution of the era with Jazz, Harlem, etc.
-   UNIA, founded by Marcus Garvey, focused on black pride and started a movement to return to Africa.
-   Emergency Immigration Act, National Origins Act limited annual admissions from each country to 2 percent of the American population from that country.
-   "The act also explicitly excluded all Asians, although, to satisfy southern and western growers, it temporarily omitted restrictions on Mexican immigrants."
-   Fundamentalist Christianity had a resurgence during the time period, very literal bible interpretations, Bible is direct word of God.
-   "Clarence Darrow, an agnostic attorney and a keen liberal mind from Chicago, volunteered to aid the defense and came up against William Jennings Bryan" in the case of evolution being banned in schools.
-   "Two events in 1915 are widely credited with inspiring the rebirth of the Klan: the lynching of Leo Frank and the release of The Birth of a Nation"
-   "Klan violence was extensive enough in Oklahoma that Governor John C. Walton placed the entire state under martial law in 1923."



"Shall the Fundamentalists Win?": Defending Liberal Protestantism in the 1920s:

-   "...the Fundamentalist program is essentially illiberal and intolerant."
-   "The question is---Has anybody a right to deny the Christian name to those who differ with him on such points and to shut against them the doors of the Christian fellowship?"
-   "Nevertheless, it is true that just now the Fundamentalists are giving us one of the worst exhibitions of bitter intolerance that the churches of this country have ever seen."



Robert Ingersoll About The Holy Bible

-   "They forget its ignorance and savagery, its hatred of liberty, its religious persecution; they remember heaven, but they forget the dungeon of eternal pain. They forget that it imprisons the brain and corrupts the heart. They forget that it is the enemy of intellectual freedom. Liberty is my religion."
-   Essentially Ingersoll dunking on religious in classic atheist format.



My observation:



I don't think we have really included the agnostic or atheist mindset into our readings thus far, and I thought that was interesting in the way that it contributes to the greater rebellion taking place in American society in all three spheres. Specifically when it comes to religion, I think the splitting of the core American Christian faint into Fundamentalism and anti-fundamentalism, or liberal Protestantism, whatever the second reading calls it, along with the growing legitimacy of the atheist and agnostic view point shines a light on the rebellion against pre-WWI philosophy present during the 1920's.
