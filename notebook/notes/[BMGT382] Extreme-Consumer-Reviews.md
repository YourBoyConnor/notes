Reddit:

-   Chick-fil-A:
    -   Not a lot of information to be honest, mostly people asking for jobs and complaining about weird orders
    -   (More info on College Park Chick-fil-A below)
-   McDonalds:
    -   A lot more info on a foreign markets (McDonalds UK, McDonalds Hong Kong, etc.)
    -   Inflation is causing more people to flock to McDonalds (Could be attractive to college students??) <https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonalds/comments/y3539b/inflation_is_apparently_turning_customers_onto/>
-   Chipotle:
    -   Problems with security on the Chipotle app
    -   Problems with how Chipotle treats their employees
    -   More positive reinforcements than Qdoba
-   Qdoba:
    -   A lot of people complaining about how bad qdoba is now, but it is mostly rewards/changes in ingredients
    -   A lot of people complaining about the health (Ex. a lot of fat in white rice, which is a very lean food usually, qdoba just uses a bunch of oil)
-   Starbucks:
    -   Starbucks does a lot of festive stuff, which attracts college age people and gets them to spend money there. A lot of pictures are on r/starbucks
-   Taco Bell:
    -   A lot of posts about the Taco Bell pass, which is a subscription for tacos that a lot of college aged people are eating almost every day. VERY targeted marketing



UMD Subreddit:

-   A lot of complaints about the dining hall and pictures of terrible food people get there, really draws students away from the dining hall and towards more appetizing options above
-   <https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/qw5y0t/favorite_stamp_restaurant/> UMD students love Chick-fil-A, and I couldn't find anyone complaining about the one in STAMP, where I found TONS of posts complaining about the dining halls
