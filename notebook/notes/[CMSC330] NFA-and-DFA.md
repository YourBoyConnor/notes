DFA: Deterministic Finite Automata

-   Easy to confirm regex acceptance, but hard to generate



NFA: Non-deterministic Finite Automata

-   Easy to build
-   Converting regex to NFA is dependent on what we need



It is easy to check regex acceptance with DFA's, but not NFA's.



Therefore, we may want to convert from NFA to DFA.



Regex -> NFA -> DFA
