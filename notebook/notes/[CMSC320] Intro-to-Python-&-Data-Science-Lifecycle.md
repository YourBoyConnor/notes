"Python is an interpreted, dynamically-typed high-level, garbage-collected, object-oriented-functional-imperative, and widely used scripting used scripting language."

- Interpreted: instructions executed without being compiled into (virtual) machine instructions
- Dynamically-typed: verifies the safety at runtime
- High-level: abstracted away from the kernel and assembly
- Garbage-collected: memory mgmt is automated
- OOF

Useful Python functions:

- Len
- Range
- Enumerate
- Map
- filter

Other useful Python tools:

- List comprehension
- Try/except

Python vs. R

- Python is a full programming language
- R has a more mature set of pure stats libraries, but Python is catching up quickly and is already ahead in ML.

5 Ways to get Data:

- Direct download and load via local storage
- Generate locally via downloaded code
- Query data from a database
- Query am API from the intra/internet
- Scrape data from a webpage

APIs can perform actions, take requests, and return some information in a structured and documented format.

Query Structure (RESTFUL):

- GET: perform query, return data
- POST: create a new entry or object
- PUT: update an existing entry or object
- PATCH: partially update an existing entry or object
- DELETE: delete an existing entry or object

JSON is a method for serializing objects:

- Convert an object into a string
- Deserialization converts a string back to an object

Regular Expressions:
