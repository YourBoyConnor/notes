Data Science = manipulating and computing on data

Need to learn to shift thinking from:

- Imperative code to manipulate data structures

To:

- Sequences/pipelines of operations on data

Data Representation

- Indexing
- Slicing/subsetting
- Filtering
- 'map' -> applying a function to every method
- 'reduce/aggregate' -> combine values to get a single value
- Dot Product/Cross Product

1. Finding the correct data structure for the pertinent data is very important

2. Data Processing Operations: Operations that take data input(s) and produce data output(s).

These tools allow you to:

- Think at a higher level of abstraction
- Separates operations and implementation
- Can switch implementations easily

Among other things, NumPy contains:

- A powerful n-dimensional array object.
- Sophisticated (broadcasting/universal) functions.
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.
- Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities, etc.

**THIS IS IMPORTANT:**

SciPy contains tools and functions for solving common problems in scientific computing, like linear algebra and stuff.

Pandas allows you to create tables (called Dataframes)

Look back at slides and Jupyter notebook if you need a refresher on 2/9 or 2/14 class.
