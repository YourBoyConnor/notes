Basics of Machine Learning



Course Goals



Syllabus



Feature Var: x^(i) = R

Target Var: y^(i) = R



Supervised Learning: Both an x and y, targets can be identified into distinct categories (classification) or otherwise operated on mathematically (regression)

Examples:

-   Classification
-   Regression

Unsupervised Learning: Only an x, algorithm doesn't have separate categories, can only identify dissimilarities in features to categorize data

Examples:

-   Generative AI
-   Dimensionality Reduction
-   Clustering



Machine Learning as Function Approximation

-   Possible Instances: X
-   Unknown Target Function: f: X -> Y
-   Set of function hypothesis J = {h | h: X -> Y}



Loss Function:

-   l(y, f(x)) -> {0 if y = f(x), 1 otherwise}
