# [CMSC424] Storage / Implementation / Optimization

## Storage Hierarchy

- Magnetic Disk Drives
  - basically an HDD
- Solid State Drives
  - Upgrade to HDD, significantly faster with no moving parts
  - NOR Flash vs. NAND Flash
  - Not much of a difference between random and sequential reads (unlike HDDs)
  - Basically a long winded introduction to [[RAID]].

I am going to leave class now, because this is a database design class and I want to see the relevance of this topic before writing all of it down in my notes. Also I want Starbucks.
